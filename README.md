# challenge-1

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to help myself practice refactor code. It is important to write clean, organized code and the code for this website needed to be fixed. If the code had been left the way it was, the next person that works on it will have a more difficult time being efficient. Now that the code has been labeled and refactored, it is a lot easier to read and understand. As a result, it will reduce future mistakes.

## Usage

The webpage for this project should not result in different formatting. Although edits were made, it only condensed the code that was already there. As you can see, the Horiseon webpage does not look different on the outside. By using HTML semantic elements, the code is more organized and fluid.
