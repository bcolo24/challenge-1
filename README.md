## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to help myself practice refactor code. It is important to write clean, organized code and the code for this website needed to be fixed. If the code had been left the way it was, the next person that works on it will have a more difficult time being efficient. Now that the code has been labeled and refactored, it is a lot easier to read and understand. As a result, it will reduce future mistakes.
